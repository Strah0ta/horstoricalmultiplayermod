 finland.20.d:0 "The Finnish proletariat along with our communist comrades have languished in Finland since the Reds lost the civil war. Germany has meanwhile become increasingly militaristic and jingoistic, constituting an existential threat to the union.

 britain.1115.d:0 "The Soviet Union is as much of a murderous and evil political regime, committing genocide against the Ukrainian people, ethnically cleansing Chechens and Tatars from their homelands, and the reducing the individual to a face cog in the wheel. In order for a free Europe to exist, the Soviet state must be destroyed."

 countrystartup.8.desc:0 "South Africa in Horstorical Multiplayer\n\nSouth Africa is a Tank Minor in Horst, generally producing Heavy Tanks for the defense of Egypt and later for Operation Torch, defending Asia, Operation Husky, and D-Day. It is expected of you to provide the allies with at least two 40 combat width motorized heavies (see templates) for Egypt.\n\nAt the start of a game, put a factory on support equipment and ask the UK for some guns and motorized at the start of the game (around 5000 and 2000 respectively). Make sure to put a mill on these later on (1940). Use your focus military factories to produce Heavy 1s for conversion into Heavy 2 SPAA.\n\nStarting off, you should do 'Support the Policy of Appeasement' and then rush down your research bonuses to get your armor bonuses from 'Armor Effort'. After this, go for your research slot focus and then continue your political focuses on the left side of your focus tree. Build Civilian Factories until 1938 and start building military factories in Jan. 1938.\n\nFor early game political power buys, rush your army theorist and tank designer. You can pick Captain of Industry and Silent Workhorse before this, but your early PP is tight due to the two former buys, so be careful. Use the Send Attache decision to avoid Strikes in 1937 and pick up Industrial Concern. You should do one or two anti-fascist raids to improve your stability and then carefully manage your PP to make sure you have your Army Attack and Armor Export advisor for the end of 1939 as well as War Economy and War bonds (500pp in total).\n\nFor research: Keep one slot on doctrine until it is finished and one slot on Heavy Tanks until you have Heavy 3. Use your remaining slots on electronics and industry research (computing techs and construction techs). Start rushing tools/dispersed as soon as you have your fourth research slot. Make sure to get Logistics 2, Engineer 2, and Radio in 1939 so you are useful for Africa.\n\nUse the tank template you get with this decision and try to have at least two divisons ready for Alamein. Ask your UK where your tanks should positioned. Most likely this will be on a city tile, hill tile, mountain tile, or across a large river. Regardless, you are supposed to play very defensively and cautiously, not giving up your entrenchment except to cycle tanks in and out of defensive positions OR to make well called for counterattacks/pins (in general, avoid this, unless ABSOLUTELY necessary).\n\nAlternate build(s): Sub out Heavy tanks for Mediums. You can either stack 2-3 tank destroyers in your template (build and convert Med 1 into TD and SPAA) and play like a Heavy SAF where you defend terrain tiles OR do a normal tank template (see the Heavy template, but use Mediums instead) and counter-attack German tanks in the Desert from the Desert tiles between and around the hills at Alamein.\n\nGood Luck and try not to lose all of your tanks!"

As Vichy, you are given access to some generic focus tree focuses for your early game build, such as research bonuses and PP, but not much in the way industry (it is all off-map). When France capitulates you will be transferred southern France and parts of the French colonial empire, depending on France's legitimacy. You also receive a substantial stockpile, but beware, most of the equipment is interwar and weak. You will have a national spirit representing the legitimacy of your country through stability, changing based off your control of the colonial empire and if you manage to stay independent of Germany or not. \n \nYou will play as a volunteer nation until Operation Torch, which, if it happens, will result in an Allied invasion of your colonial holdings, namely Algeria. Defend Algeria at all costs, as it is a test of whether or not Vichy France is a nation that can stand up to Allies and fight as an independent member of the Axis powers, or as a weak and illegitimate puppet state. If you manage to do so well that you reclaim all of Frances colonial empire AND join the Axis as an independent state then you can sign a final peace settlement with Germany, legitimizing Vichy France as the true France. \n \nThis is not a nation recommended for newer players, as it is challenging and harsh, as it is dependent on how well the Axis and Allies play. Additionally, Force Attack is DISABLED on Vichy France!\n \nFor research, your focus should on one of the following:\n1) Making use of your aging tank equipment by converting them into more modern tank variants, such as converting Medium 1 tanks into Medium 2 SPGs. You can do this from after the Fall of France and it would require very little research to achieve.\n2) Using your armor bonus to rush Medium/Heavy 3 tanks after hard researching Medium 2 tanks and focusing on tanks.\n3) Using your infantry/artillery bonuses to rush gun 2/3 or artillery 2/3 for strong infantry divisions.\n\nYour research should reflect how you want to play Vichy France and ultimately how you wish to defend North Africa. It is recommended to do Superior Firepower (R/R) AT mountaineers if you are unsure about what you are doing.\n\nYou have a number of potentially useful templates to use if you check your templates. One very unconventional one is an SPG template, which is normally a bad idea, but it is the only way to make good use of your medium 1 or light 2 tank stockpile (conversion). It is recommended to use all the equipment you have at your disposal, even if it is not meta."

 countrystartup.4.desc:0 "Finland is an industrially weak minor in Horstorical, but that doesn't stop it from fielding an army of nearly one million men on the field during Operation Barbarossa.  The majority of your game will be building up for invading the Soviet Union during Barbarossa, known as the Continuation War, which starts by event. Most of your guns will be of poor quality, illsuited for pushing or holding on their own without support companies, artillery, and anti-tank, especially against Soviet tank divisions. You should do quality infantry, specifically Special Forces, and 20w infantry with line anti-tank and support artillery/rocket artillery. Research Improved Anti-Tank, Improved Artillery, and Improved Infantry Equipment as soon as possible, as these are the minimum you need for holding against Russia. License produce rocket artillery as soon as possible. You can use these divisions for pushing through Soviet infantry and dealing with Soviet tank divisions.\n\nThe Winter War is scripted in Horstorical, you will lose the states Karjala and Salla to the Soviet Union when Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact occurs. Please note that you have a substantial amount of industry in Karjala and Lappi, as well resources in Lappi. Because of these losses, you should start building military factories by early 1937. \n\nAlthough you start with 30% recruitable population, you are unable to change your conscription law. To get more manpower you have a national spirit which gives manpower every week and consumer goods, representing German support for the Finnish War effort. You can increase the efffect of this spirit by recapturing your core territory, capturing you focus core territory, and capturing Leningrad.\n\nAs Finland, you have the following four objectives: \n1) Preventing the Soviet Union from pushing into the interior of Finland and knocking you out of the war.\n2) The liberation of the Finnish city of Viipuri from Soviet occupation.\n3) The capture of Port of Murmansk, which is one of the supply routes that the Soviets need to control in order to receive Allied lend-lease.\n4) The capture of Leningrad, a key Soviet victory point and a fortress which seperates you from your Axis Allies.\n\n Above all else, do not fail your first objective.\n\nCheck your division templates for some useful templates to use against the Soviet Union. You will have two 20w templates, one that can hold against Soviet infantry and tanks, and another to hold against naval invasions. You will also receive a 40w template that you will use to push Soviet infantry/tanks, ideally with Special Forces instead of regular infantry."

 countrystartup.5.desc:0 "The United Kingdom in Horsorical has two major roles:\n1) Organize, direct, and assist the Allies in playing out your game plan\n2) Air Controller and the primary fighter manufacturer for the Allies\n\nFor fulfilling the first role you need to have a strong understanding of most Allied minors, the overall gameflow in Horst, and how to defend, counter-attack, and attack as a faction against the Axis. New players should avoid playing the UK. As far as the second one is concerned, UK is one of the most difficult nations to play against a capable enemy team because you will be on the backfoot in the airwar until Barbarossa. You need to know what to do to not lose important assets during that time, such as your navy, the Dutch East Indies, and airports. You need to dedicate your entire economy on fighter production from 1938 until 1941, when you can start putting new military factories on other equipment. If you possess enough fighters and (American made) tactical bombers, you can deal with many problems pretty easily. Axis are convoy raiding in Western Approaches? Put up fighters and bombers on Naval Strike. Japan is naval invading an obscure island? Put up bombers on CAS mission. Axis are building new airports near the frontline to gain aerial supremacy? Bomb their airports. There are many problems you must deal with and most of them are or in part solved by effective air micro.\n\nYou should aim for close to 200 mills on fighters for late 1940. How to do this and maximize production? You need to do the following:\n1) Build infrastructure for the first half of 1936 in states with significant building slots in the UK - you will max out each of these states by 1941.\n2) You must hard research all industry tech 3 as soon as possible so that you can later apply industry research bonuses to Tools 4 (Assembly Line) and Tools 5 Left (Flexible Line)\n3) Go and stay Free Trade - you get a better bonus to production, construction, and research while selling more of your unused resources (steel) to your faction.\n\nArmy: You need a diversity of templates to efficienctly cover the Mediterrenean, Middle East, and Atlantic ports. Check your division templates ASAP as the decision gave you some useful templates.\n\nFleet: Watch out what Italy is doing and react accordingly: if he makes a surface fleet, refit your fleet to fight it (see Refit guide). If he spams subs, build destroyers (see ASW guide), avoid Axis naval bombers as much as possible.\n\nAir: Until 1941 the focus is on defending Egypt and avoiding Axis sorties against shipping in the Atlantic. When Japan declares, you need to make sure you have enough fighters in Asia to prevent Japan from getting easy green air AND to defending your shipping near the UK/Gibraltar to avoid being raided by Axis submarines/fleet. Later into 1941 and onwards, if Asia has been reasonable contained, you should have enough Fighter 3 production to begin targetting the Axis again, and using air to assist the Allies to retake Egypt (if it was lost) and invade Vichy North Africa in Operation Torch. From there, prepare for Husky, Overlord, or an invasion of Norway."

 countrystartup.6.desc:0 "Norway in Horstorical is mainly played post-capitulation, like Free France. You start your game with two very bad national spirits, one which weakens your dockyard output and surrender limits, and another which lowers your attack and defense by 70%, as well as your entrenchment by 10. These spirits are easily removed through focuses, but they are date locked OR available after being at war with Germany. You will also be outside the Allies for a period of two weeks, unable to receive any kind of assistance. Holding Norway is not realistic, so you should only put up a token defense in most cases.\n\nYou should rush your research slot and focus your research on rushing gun 3 and Superior Firepower (R/R) as it will give you very strong attack modifiers on your Special Forces (doctrines) as well breakthrough/defense. Keep in mind that Marines/Mountaineers have a 100% breakthrough modifier on the base stat, allowing them to be able to sustain pushes more easily. Your allies might ask you to rush a particular research, like Anti-Tank Armored Cars or Anti-Tank 3. Always use your bonuses on the latest possible technologies when rushing techs!\n\nAfter losing Norway don't worry too much about lost production efficiency as you have a focus to regain it quickly. Your ultimate goal is to support an Allied retake of Norway, but until then you should help the Allies out elsewhere, like in Africa for Operation Torch (invasion of Vichy Africa). Between Norway falling and retakes in Europe, you should have plenty of time to produce very good marines and/or mountaineers. On that note, you should try using your SF research bonuses on the SF research tree to rush for Elite Special Forces. In Horst, you get a 300% research bonus on Transport Models as Norway, use this Advanced Landing Craft as the Naval Invasion Defense stat will lower your naval invade penalty. Be sure to finish your 'Operation Crofter' focus just before you reinvade Norway, as you get an attack bonus from it for 90 days.\n\nOne last thing: Don't forget to research Battlefield Support! Ground Support modifiers work for anyone controlling divisions! You can increase your air support modifier from 25% to 35% with both Ground Support researches from Battlefield Support!"
 
 countrystartup.8.desc:0 "Welcome to Horstorical Multiplayer South Africa Guide!\n\nSouth Africa is a Tank Minor in the mod, generally producing Heavy Tanks for the defense of Egypt and later Torch, Asia defense, Husky, D-Day etc. It is expected of you to provide the allies with at least two 40 combat width motorized(8-9) heavies(10-11) for Egypt, that also contain line SP-AA(2). Support companies must include Engineer, Recon and Logistics.\n\nNow that you know what you need to have for the start of the war, we can talk about how to achieve that. First of all, communicate with the UK player at the start of the game and ask him much infantry equipment(4000-6000), support equipment(4-600) and motorized(2000-2500) he will be able to give to you. The numbers in the parentheses would last you roughly until the middle of 1940, then you must either rely on your own production or other allies lend leases(USA, FRANCE, UK etc.). Ideally, you would only be producing TANKS and SP-AAs from the moment you got HEAVY TANK 1, but be prepared to spare some mills from 1940 onward for the above mentioned equipment even if UK is kind enough to trust with such quantities before the start of the war.\n\nThe Focus Tree path is pretty simple: get the partial mobilization focus, rush the tank bonuses, go for research slot by taking the consumer goods reduction and steel and then do whatever you see fit(factory construction speed, stability etc).\n\nConstruction management is also quite simple: because you get partial mobilization after a 70 days focus at the start of the game, build 1 level of infra maybe in CAPE and then build civs in the highest infra provinces until you are 2 months away from getting HEAVY 2. Then just mills for the entire game.\n\nPolitical power picks should include captain of industry, tank designer(mobile?), military atache decision to avoid strikes after the start of 37, military theorist, industrial concern silent workhorse and the military advisors(army attack and armor expert before the war).\n\nResearch priorities are:\n1. HEAVY TANK!! Research HEAVY 1 and juggle it if you know how to, then HARD research Heavy 2 before you get the bonus and apply the bonus to it, then keep on researching Heavy 3 until you get that as well.\n2. Construction 1 and 2.\n3. Electronic Mechanical Engineering\n4. Land doctrine. After you are done with Electronic Mechanical Engineering, keep a slot on land doctrine until it is done. The doctrine of choice for heavy tanks is MW RIGHT-RIGHT.\n5. Mechanical Computing + tools 1,2 dispersed 1,2. After you are done with these, focus on getting tools 3 and dispersed 3 as quickly as possible to increase your early tank production. Tools 4 should be hard researched starting in 39 as well.\n\nWith all that being said, try to get as many tanks out as you can with the 11-8-2 template i mentioned in the introduction and ask the UK player where to place them and how to use them. Heavy Tanks will generally be used defensively in the starting part of the war, one per tile, entrenched on terrain(cities, hill, marshes, mountains).\n\nGood Luck and try not to lose all of your tanks!"

 countrystartup.15.desc:0 "Hello and Welcome to Horstorical Multiplayer Germany Guide!\n\nGermany is probably the most difficult nation to play and if you are not the most or one of the most experienced players in the lobby, playing it would be ill-advised. You will also need an AC co-op and it is recommended to have at least another 2, making it a total of 4 Germany players for an optimum game.\n\nYou are air controller and main tank manufacturer with an industry the size of USA's and UK's combined, for balancing reasons.\n\nThe Focus Tree and PP are buys  pretty standard, with the mention that many events such as Anschluss and war declarations are made by decisions. You get the fighters by focuses, so do not research them.\nResearch priorities should include tanks(Mediums, please!), land doctrine(MW or die), industry(Flexible line rush to switch to fighter 3), air doctrine before war, refining tech, support companies etc.\n\nConstruction should include minimal infra(Rhineland + Mossenland), all civs should be finished by 1st Jan '38, mills until March - April '39, then refs until start of war, then mills and refs as needed(mostly mills).\n\nOne issue you will have to deal with is RESISTANCE SUPPRESSION. Use INTERWAR armored car divisions(10-15 mills from the start of the game, 20-30 by BARB), spy micro and resistance law micro(CIV OVERSIGHT for high compliance, MILITARY GOVERNOR for low compliance).\n\nAnother issue is fuel management. Fuel silos are 10 times cheaper than vanilla and all fuel values are 4 times lower. Aim for minimum 3 million fuel stockpile at barb. Other starting production should include a bit of support equipment, AA, scout planes, 5-8 on motorized and rest on guns(The starting stockpile is all you get except France). As you start building mills, i would recommend putting the first 180 minimum on fighters, then go up on tanks and CAS.\n\nIf you are worried that you will not have enough tanks for Africa or France, remember that Spain is expected to help you out with both.\n\nAs i have mentioned, you should go MW(right - right), motorized mediums(9-10 motorized, SP-AA's and TD's as well) for France and Africa. Later, for Barb, remove the SP-AA's and TD's(Soviet is no AIR, medium tank spam, usually).\nThe oil from IRAQ is very useful to have, but not game - breaking, so you should not kill yourself over getting it.\n\nRegarding Barb, you need 5 things: tanks(45+), infantry(200k+ guns), CAS(2k+) , scout planes(2+ mills on it all game) and INTERWAR armored cars to deal with resistance(20-30 mills on it by barb and 20-30k+ stockpile).\n\nItaly's job is to do quality infantry(SPF 20w with sup companies seem to be enough), SPAIN mediums(or heavies), HUNGARY heavies(or mediums), Romania SPECIAL FORCES, VICHY license produces your mediums without needing resources.\n\nWinter is modded on barb, so do not push in winter unless you see a way to obtain an immediate advantage. Attrition losses during winter are huge and you do not want to run out of guns/motorized/support equipment.\n\nGood luck and do your best!"
 
 countrystartup.16.desc:0 "Hello and Welcome to Horstorical Multiplayer Italy Guide!\n\nItaly is the Axis infantry major, expected to provide garrisons for pretty much everywhere. You are faced with the challenge of balancing between quantity(A LOT OF COAST TILES ON D-DAY AND THE MED) and quality(divisions decent enough not to immediately roll over and die).\n\nThe most cost-efficient approach is spamming SUPERIOR FIREPOWER RIGHT-RIGHT 20 widths with mostly Gun 2's(you can do Gun 3 IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING) and support companies(ENGINEER, AA, ARTY, ROCKET ARTY, RECON/LOGISTICS). You should have a minimum of 1.5 million men in the field before you join the war, 4-5 million by barb and 6-7 million by the start of 42.\n\nThere are a few tricks which you can use to achieve that:\n- get your gun 2 as quickly as possible(March '38, YES!) - start going for it at the start of '37 at the very latest. Build mills 1-2 months before you get it.\n- rush arty 2, arty 3 and rocket arty 1 and 2. Start producing every single of them  as soon as you get them.\n- before you gun 2, focus on overproducing AA and sup equipment and do not produce that many gun 1's(they are bad).\n\nFocus tree Path is pretty vanilla. The only thing you need to pay close attention to is the world tension. Do not go above 9.99% before 1st Jan '38. Go for research slot at first and the infra focus below that. Delay the second mill focus until you get arty 2 or you need the bonuses for arty 3 in order to keep your consumer goods low. Prioritize getting rocket arty 2 and arty 3 to anything else other than doctrine and gun 2(3?). Steal industrial tech(tools) if you are able to.\n\nConstruction is pretty simple as well: conversion?(your choice) then civs as we've discussed, then mills go brr. The 2 most essential PP buys are, in this order, War Economy and Captain of Industry. Later choose rocket scientist instead of military theorist.\n\nNavy is not really worth it unless you really go for it(doctrine, 10-20 docks, DD3's, Cruiser 3's etc) or UK is a bad player. NAV 2's might seem like a good item to have, but they are not worth going for because CAS 3 kills navies and naval invasions just fine and Germany has a pretty good incentive to research and build it.\n\nFor Africa, some AT infantry(9 inf, 2 AT) will prove useful in repelling Torch, with the help of some tanks from Germany or Axis minors, but do not overdo it with AT early on. Focus on not letting them land in Europe and Norway until '43, when the Allies get their good generals and planning.\n\nGood luck and do not forget to get a good co-op before torch!"

 countrystartup.17.desc:0 "Hello And Welcome to the Horstorical Multiplayer France guide!\n\nFrance is the most important TANK MINOR(Major) in the Allied Faction and one of the most fun nations in the game. You get to play with motorized medium tanks in Europe, Africa and Asia(and America, on occasion). The challenge consists in not losing them.\n\nTemplate of choice consists of 9 to 10 motorized, 9 to 10 medium tanks and 2 SP-AA's, with support engineer, motorized recon and logistics for Africa(maintenance helps as well). You are expected to get out between 9 and 12 of these out for France(you could get as many as 14-15 with dispersed industry and best play from both you and the soviets).\n\nThe Focus Tree Path that i prefer is rushing Strengthen Government, then going for Colonial Industry and research slot, then Promote Entrepreneurship, Defensive Stratagems, Aggressive Focus, Defensive Focus( land doctrine bonus!!), Stimulate the Dynamic Market, Military Factories, Research Slot and Army Reform via Battle of Maneuver. The advantage of rushing Strengthen Government is the ability to pick Financial Expert(-5% consumer goods) after Silent Workhorse, which is both BETTER than War Industrialist and ESSENTIAL after capitulation to achieve 0% consumer goods. After Financial Expert, save up Political Power for Partial Mobilization(1st Jan '38), and then pick Humble Appeaser, Industrial Effort and later, Mobile Tank Designer, before the Army Staff for the battle of France.\n\nResearch priorities are: TANK, LAND DOCTRINE(MW RIGHT RIGHT), TOOLS 5(FLEXIBLE LINE), construction, mechanical computing etc. Construction is pretty easy: max infra GABON and MIDDLE CONGO and build mills there and in other colonial provinces.\n\nDuring the Battle of France you will have to FIGHT FOR LEGITIMACY, which unlocks access to different COLONIAL provinces where you've previously(hopefully) built up your industry. For this event, you should be using your tanks as well as 20 width and/or 40 width infantry with just support AA(engineer?) to DELAY Germany's advance for as long as possible while getting enough legitimacy(over 20) to keep the bulk of your industry(GABON, MIDDLE CONGO).\n\nYour main objective at this point is keeping your tanks alive. It is socially acceptable to have CONVERTERS READY in Africa and delete your tanks after they have arrived safely to a port In FRANCE. MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT CAPITULATE BEFORE YOU GET THE TANKS OUT OR YOU HAVE CONVERTED THE AFRICAN CONVERTERS INTO ACTUAL TANKS!\n\nFrom this point on, it will be your responsibility to micro tanks wherever they are needed(Africa, Asia, Torch, Norway, D-DAY) and the success of every operation largely depends on your skill and coordination with your allies. Good luck!"

 countrystartup.18.desc:0 "Hello and welcome to the Horstorical Multiplayer USA guide!\n\nUSA is the major industrial power in the Allies, responsible with helping the UK with winning the air war, defending the rubber against Japan and later providing the high quality anti-tank infantry needed for operations such as Torch, retaking of Iraq, Egypt, Norway, Husky and finally D-Day.\n\nPlaying the first 4 years on USA has become less difficult in the past few updates. Resource decisions are no longer needed  while on Undisturbed Isolation and your civilian industry should be instead focused on building up the infra in the main aluminium and steel states. The minimum infra needed, in my opinion, is maxing out the following states: Washington, Tennessee, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Arkansas and Ohio. One level in California and one in Texas would be useful as well. The standard Focus Tree Path is now entirely self explanatory to anyone who has played USA before: Continue The New Deal, WPA, Agricultural Adjustment Act, Neutrality Act, Scientific Research&Development, War Department, Selective Training Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Air War Plans Divisions, Arsenal Of Democracy, Scientist Haven, then HOLD FOCUS until 1st Jan '38 for Giant Wakes. If you do not get enough war support by that date, click the Military Attache decision to get 10 more. After Giant Wakes is done, make sure to Amend the Budget as quickly as possible, pick War Industrialist advisor and build mills until the world runs out of steel(or rubber) on export focus. The next most important focuses after that are The Federal Housing Act, Military Construction, Wartime Industry and USACE Projects. Then you can move on to navy, air or military focuses, depending on your situation or build choices.\n\nThe first thing you absolutely need to get right is building enough planes to help UK win the air war and this is exactly why getting the first years right is extremely important. You will be asked to put anywhere from 100 to 140 mils on fighters, 15-25 on Tactical Bombers and 20-50 on CAS(later in the game, though), as well as to build enough guns, arty, rocket arty, AA and support equipment to defend the rubber Islands.\n\nYour second objective is stonewalling Japan in Asia. The simplest way of achieving this is to Spam 20 width pure infantry with quality support companies(engi, AA, arty, rocket arty, logi/recon). You need about 220-250+. Create 3 templates: one with GUN 1 only, one with GUN 2 only, one with GUN 3 only and place them accordingly. Also rush arty 3 by yourself and get rocket arty 1 and 2 from UK. Gun 3 is good to have as well(ask NORWAY to rush it).\n\nBuilding a BIG navy is a bad idea. You do not have the industry to do so and it might lose you the air war. You can refit or sub spam as you see fit. Japans usually do not build a Navy either, so you will be fine(but be careful of their navs!).\n\nFinally, after containing Japan, you have to set your eyes on Europe. For Torch, Norway, Aswan 20 width AT mountaineers(9-2s) work best(license produce it from Australia). For D-Day, 20 width marines. For Husky, a mix of marines and mountaineers. Tanks are generally provided by the tank minors/majors.\n\nBefore attempting any landing, you need to make sure UK can provide air coverage for the naval invasion, otherwise it will get bombed. Also, you need to have naval invasion tech 3 if you face resistance during landing and tell UK to put up CAS for you.\n\nGood luck and carry your team to victory!"

 multialtitude_flyingx:0 "Multi-Altitude Flying"
 multialtitude_flyingx_desc:0 "Air combat takes place in three dimensions, but most pilots find it harder to keep track of planes flying above or below them. We can take advantages of this by spreading our formations vertically."

 offensive_formationsx_desc:0 "Training in more offensively-oriented formations make our fighters deadlier in combat."
 fighter_sweepsx:0 "Fighter Sweeps"

 forward_interceptionx:0 "Forward Interception"
 forward_interceptionx_desc:0 "By operating closer to enemy airspace it becomes more likely that our fighters can intercept enemy planes before they can reach their targets."
 fighter_veteran_initiativex:0 "Fighter Veteran Initiative"

 air_skirmishx:0 "Air Skirmish"
 air_skirmishx_desc:0 "Regrettably, it is not always possible to destroy every single enemy plane found over our country, but it is possible to harass them from the moment they are spotted until the moment they leave, constantly wearing them down."
 home_defencex:0 "Home Defense"
 home_defencex_desc:0 "Spotters on the ground as well as detection and listening posts work in concert with our air force to track and destroy enemy incursions."
 battlefield_destructionx:0 "Battlefield Destruction"

 battlefield_supportx:0 "Battlefield Support"
 battlefield_supportx_desc:0 "It is difficult for Tactical bombers to attack targets near where our ground forces are in combat, since level bombing is less accurate than dive bombing, but more training and interaction with ground-based observers can help to overcome these problems."
 carousel_bombingx:0 "Carousel Bombing"
 carousel_bombingx_desc:0 "Bombers often simply want to dump all their bombs as soon they reach their target area and then fly home as soon as possible. While this can work for area-bombing, when it comes to hitting a small target it is more effective to linger over the target, dropping only a portion of their bomb load at a time for maximum accuracy."

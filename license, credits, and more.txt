Thank you to the above mods for explicit or implicit permission granted for use of assets.

Thank you Lennard#0034 for the 'Fuel System', 'Horsttool',
and 'Top Bar Resources' feature that were imported from 
HFU/LW. Thanks for some of your creative and innovative 
modding ideas, which inspired me to make changes based
on them (doctrinal flexiblity on tanks/infantry)
or wholly importing them (air doctrine removal, enabling
Italy/USA to AC potentially). He and Beethoven are the only
modders I have much respect for when it comes to modding
a mod as a historical MP mod (withstanding larp, which I
give respect to HoO for).

Thank you Xen/Birran/XenJang/whatever discord name you use now
(the guy that makes the gfx for HoO) for use of graphical assets.

Thank you Mushrix and ~christian hussar for creating graphical
assets for Horstorical Multiplayer.

Thank you to Sadek from Sadek mod, for modding assistance.

Thank you Battlehammer and anyone that has supported Horstorical
in reuploading it.

Thank you to MilkyBob. Though we had our differences, thank you
for everything you have done to help me with the mod.

Thanks to everyone who helped me along the way, including my 
longtime hosts, who kept the mod going forward.
